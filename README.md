# ResQL

ResQL is a Node.js ORM for working with MySQL an PostgreSQL databases.

If you're in Bangalore and you're interested in Node.js, open source and getting
paid for what you love to do, Askabt is looking to sponsor full- or part-time
contributors to ResQL. Write to [askabt@askabt.in](mailto:askabt@askabt.in).

## Comparison with [Sequelize](http://github.com/sdepold/sequelize):

Sequelize is currently the most popular Node.js ORM.

Before going into the differences in detail, note that Sequelize is a
fairly mature project and ResQL is not - right now you shouldn't use ResQL for
production code.

ResQL's _raison d'Ãªtre_ is that it lets you code without nested callbacks. It
accomplishes this by two techniques:
 - Function chaining to express complex chains of model queries, which are then
   combined using an SQL query builder before a DB call is made.
 - Using the [CommonJS Promises/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A) API
   to allow chaining of your own operations with model queries.

Example: Consider the following code you might write using Sequelize:

```javascript
students.find({where: {id: 34235}}).success(function(student) {
	student.getCourses().success(function(courses) {
		console.log(courses);
	});
});
```

With ResQL, it's much neater:

```javascript
students.one({id: 34235}).courses().then(function(courses) {
	console.log(courses);
});
```

ResQL is also more efficient as it makes a single optimized SQL query (using
subqueries if necessary):

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Courses" WHERE id IN (
	SELECT courseId FROM "StudentCourses" WHERE userId='34235'
)
```

instead of

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Students" WHERE "id"='34235'
SELECT * FROM "StudentCourses" WHERE "userId"='34235'
SELECT * FROM "Courses" WHERE "id" IN (...)
```

ResQL also provides an HTTP/REST API for reading and writing to the DB in the
form of Connect/Express middleware.

Another thing to note is that the data modeling APIs stay close to the actual
table schema - you have complete control over foreign key names, for instance,
and still get the benefits of the ORM's relation handling. A single intuitive
relation() call replaces Sequelize's hasOne(), hasMany() and belongsTo().
